                We are a company that believes in doing the right business, 
                in the right way. Everything we do as a company has an impact on society, 
                the economy and the environment. However, this impact is more than we think. 
                Corporate social responsibility forms an integral part of our sustainability strategy, 
                which underpins most of our decisions we make for our businesses.
                <br/> <br/>
                Our corporate social responsibility cuts across everyone and everything we get in touch with. 
                Thus from our employees to suppliers, and clients to the communities in which we operate in. 
                We want to ensure we sustain safe operations, have a positive and supportive impact on our employees, 
                the communities we work in and the wider environment, and ensuring we continually strive to build the 
                trust and respect our clients.
                <br/> <br/>
                We have a long-term corporate social responsibility objective, which is to impact, 
                and improve the quality of life of the individuals in the communities we operate in through 
                our special initiatives. We want to ensure that the people within communities in which we 
                operate in are educated, are of good health, practicing good sanitation and are given maximum 
                protection.
