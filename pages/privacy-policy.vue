            <h4 class="mt-4">Third Party Websites</h4>
            <p>The Site and our mobile application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services that are not affiliated with us.

No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
